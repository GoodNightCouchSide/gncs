## Installation
Clone the repo and run 

```bash
npm install
```

Run the app via
```bash
npm start
```
and have fun on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


## Development

How to name your supporting branch prefixes?   
- `feature/`  
- `bugfix/`  
- `release/`  
- `hotfix/`  
- `support/`   
Version tag prefix? [] 
// TODO Update
Hooks and filters directory? [/home/tim/workspace/gncs/web-app/.git/hooks]

## Code formatting and linting

To run the code formatting tool:

```bash
$ npm run format
```

This will cause [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to automatically fix any code correctness issues.

To run the linting checks:

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

This will not attempt any automatic fixes, which is preferable during test runs.

## Testing

We are planning to test our app with Jest
