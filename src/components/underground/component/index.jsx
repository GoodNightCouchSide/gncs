          Is the raised child of a bunch of music enthusiasts who are sick of not
          having a fully packed 24/7 concert schedule week by week. So what’s to do?
          Keep being sick or unleash the inner DIY-monster and create your own book of
          great excuses for not coming to your former school mates boring house party.
          We decided wisely, went down the bar, turned on the mind machines and GOOD NIGHT COUCH SIDE was born.
          <br />
          <br />
          With this project we’re trying to give you an overview about all the upcoming
          cool shows in berlin (more cities in the pipe). We love to support the
          small underground venues – as much as bands and bookers – and that they
          wanna share their magic with the crowd even more than spending every hard
          earned penny for big promotion. GNCS is the solution – better said the stage –
          loaded with stunner lineups and awesome shows!
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition to make this really an complete schedule for your affinities,
          bigger events and more common venues will get some space too.
          The only mantra we’re following: No racist-homophobic-sexism-nationalism-bullshit!
          <br />
          <br />
          This is your permission to get off the couch and take a sniff of real
          urban music scene around the corner. No matter if it’s punk, hardcore,
          stoner, doom, sludge, grindcore, death, blackmetal, rap, jazz, classic
          or any other tiny diy-sub genre which is born in the hearts and minds
          of people who are doing this for the same reason as we created this site – music for everyone!
          <br />
          <br />
          GOOD NIGHT COUCH SIDE is a project by Carlo, Jacoba, Jörg, Robert, Tim
          and all the editors who helps us keeping you up to date.
